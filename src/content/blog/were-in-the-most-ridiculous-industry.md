I stumbled across Zach Holman's blog via a post on Signal vs. Noise. It was about his screencast [Automating Inefficiencies](https://zachholman.com/2011/01/automating-inefficiencies/), you should check this out as well.

Anyway, I skimmed the headlines in his [blog](https://zachholman.com/) and ended up reading quite some of the articles. In one post he talks about his side-project _Facelette_ (Chat Roulette for FaceTime). He emphasizes he made it for the sake of hacking, not to start the-next-big-thing&trade; what indeed was what some people thought about it.

Instead, for him...

> We're in the most ridiculous industry on earth. You can whip something up in a few hours and before you know it, people around the world will be using it.
> That is insane. An architect or a fireman or a lawyer or anyone else can't say that for their profession or their hobby.
>
> â€” <cite>Zach Holman</cite>

[Read the whole piece](https://zachholman.com/2010/10/facelette-on-techcrunch-in-three-hours-and-zero-dollars/), there also is some wisdom by \_why in there.

Okay, what is my point again? @holman does some cool things, yes.

But reading those lines made me also realize once again, tools and the cleverest plans don't matter - execution counts. Hack something up, flip the switch and see how it goes. This also reaffirmed my decision to study Computer Science and especially being creative & curious about related subjects. This should enable me (at least potentially, let's see how that goes...) to be in this industry, the most ridiculous on earth.

**And who wouldn't want to work there?**
